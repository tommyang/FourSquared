<h2 id="important">Important!</h2>

<p>If not installed properly, angular WILL throw an exception. </p>

<pre><code>&quot;No module: ui.directives&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Which means you have not included the angular-ui library in the file, or the shiv is in the wrong place.</p>

<p>WHY? Well, angular is throwing the exception and I can&#8217;t catch and stop it. If properly setup, you should be good.
If not, then you should probably fix it or yank it out. Of course, then you won&#8217;t have the shiv for ie. </p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>This is used in order to support IE versions that do not support custom elements. For example: </p>

<pre><code> &lt;ng-view&gt;&lt;/ng-view&gt;
 &lt;ui-currency ng-model=&quot;somenum&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui-currency&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>IE 8 and earlier do not allow custom tag elements into the DOM. It just ignores them.
In order to remedy, the trick is to tell browser by calling document.createElement(&#8216;my-custom-element&#8217;).
Then you can use, <my-custom-element>&#8230;</my-custom-element>, you also may need to define css styles. </p>

<p>In current version, this will automagically define directives found in the ui.directives module and
angular&#8217;s ngView, ngInclude, ngPluralize directives.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>The shiv needs to run after angular has compiled the application. Best to load angular-ui-ieshiv.js at
bottom of <head> section. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;build/angular-ui-ieshiv.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="options">Options</h3>

<pre><code>There will be
</code></pre>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<pre><code>- modules are searched for directives 
- only IE 8 and earlier will cause shiv to run
- there will be a slight performance hit (for IE) 
</code></pre>

<h3 id="todo">Todo</h3>

<pre><code>- provide ability to specify which directives to include/exclude
- automagically locate all custom directives in current ng-app (this will involve recursion)
